# Vector_Similarity
* Python, Java implementation of TS-SS called from "A Hybrid Geometric Approach for Measuring Similarity Level Among Documents and Document Clustering"
* Also, I have summarized "A Hybrid Geometric Approach for Measuring Similarity Level Among Documents and Document Clustering"
* I recommend TS-SS instead of Cosine distance or Euclidean distance.

# The reasons are... 

## Cosine drawbacks

## Euclidean drawbacks
![euclidean drawback](./image/euclidean_drawback.JPG)

## Triangle's Area Similarity (TS)

## Sector's Area Similarity (SS)

## TS-SS

# Results

# Conclusion
* In biggest dataset, TS-SS outperforms Cosine with a significant difference, while in other datasets TS-SS outperforms Cosine slightly

* Therefore, the significant better result of TS-SS in biggest dataset justifies the robustness and reliability of the model for big data and real world data where the variety of documents/texts are high
